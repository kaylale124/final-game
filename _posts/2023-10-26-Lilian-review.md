## Issues
### [Week 1](https://github.com/kaylale124/final-game/commit/563c2c9f005510ef8c312dd8fc15fd0f6573f420)
- Picked enemy sprite image (coyote)
- Made the coyote sprite animation (enemy) show up 
    - Adjusted the dimensions of image
- Added downward translaton of coyote grid

### [Week 2](https://github.com/kaylale124/final-game/commit/88fc4181fa3d61ca91553741f45163bd23ac0c5f)
- Made the grid of coyotes independent sprites
- Changed the grid format to an upside-down pyramid
- Created the game screen
- Integrated the background and coyotes most of the week
- Made the coyotes appear from the top of the page and move downwards
- Tried setting up a score system
### [Week 3](https://github.com/kaylale124/final-game/commit/0a792af965592520afa532f326ea31e42028b0d7)
- Worked on a scoring system (failed)
    - Problems: wrong integration of coyotes and background, wrong place to use collisions (should use on mainpage with everything already integrated), y-coordinate of coyotes to determine score deduction did not work
    - Suggestions: use object oriented programming, refer to teacher's code instead of just using ChatGPT, seek teammates for more help
- Added teacher's coyote code to our repository and made few adjustments
- Plan: work on local storage, scoring system, final boss?
